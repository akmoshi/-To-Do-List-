# To-Do List - Tutorial
This web project is about creating a list of any important work.

# What the Project Does

1. Provides a simple To-Do List application where users can add, complete, and remove tasks.

2. Stores tasks in local storage, so the list persists even after refreshing the page.

3. Offers an interactive and responsive interface for easy task management.

4. Displays checked (completed) tasks with visual indication (strike-through and different icon).
   

# Tools / Languages Used – Purpose

1. HTML: Creates the structure of the application (input box, button, list container).

2. CSS: Adds styling for layout, color scheme, and responsive design.

3. JavaScript: Handles task operations (add, delete, mark complete) and localStorage for data persistence.

4. Browser: Runs the application locally without any additional software.
   

# Steps to Build and Run

* Create Files:

1. index.html → App layout (input, button, task list).

2. style.css → Visual design and responsiveness.

3. script.js → Logic for adding, deleting, saving, and loading tasks.

4. Link CSS and JS: Ensure style.css and script.js are linked in index.html.

5. Add Images: Place checked.png, uncheck.png, and icon.png in an images folder.

6. Run the App: Open index.html in any modern browser.
   

# Key Features

1. Add Task: Insert tasks dynamically via input field and button.

2. Mark Complete: Click on a task to toggle between complete/incomplete (visual check mark).

3. Delete Task: Remove tasks instantly by clicking the × icon.

4. Persistent Storage: Saves tasks using localStorage, so tasks remain after page reload.



# Challenges Faced

1. Dynamic DOM Updates: Managing event listeners for newly added tasks.

2. Persistent Storage: Implementing localStorage to retain tasks.

3. Styling: Making design responsive and visually appealing with hover effects.

4. Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring layout and icons display correctly.

5. Error Handling: Preventing empty tasks from being added.
